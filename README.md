# Fullstack Coding Test

This repository contains my result for the JavaScript Developer Coding Test. I really like to give my ideia in front-end development, and back-end development. The test consists of three levels:

## Level 1: Front-end Development

### Project Overview

For Level 1, I have created a sample web page t in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6). I have also use Bootstrap for responsiveness and ReactJS to demonstrate my skills in modern JavaScript frameworks.

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap


### The Project is structured as

The project structure for Level 1 consists of the following key components:

- `src/`: Contains React components front-end.
- `public/`: The public directory for static assets.

### Running the Project

To view the web page, you can set up a development server for React by navigating to the `src/` directory and running the development server command.

## Level 2: Front-end and Back-end Integration

### Project Overview

For Level 2, I have created a form that collects user data and sends it to the backend for validation. I've implemented form validation and made API calls to the backend to validate input filds.

### Technologies Used

- Form Validation: Front-end validation with js vanilla
- Front-end: Next.js

- `app/`: App contains the app layout pages.
- `components/`: Components contains the components used in frontend.

### Running the Project

To run the project:

1. Navigate to the `2task/` directory and run `npm run dev`.

## Level 3: I Used the MongoDB Integration 

### Project Overview

 The user information is stored in a MongoDB database.

### Technologies Used

- Database: MongoDB
- Back-end: Node.js (Express.js)

## Conclusion

I like This coding test cause I could use my skills in JavaScript, front-end development, and back-end development. The project is divided into levels, with each level building upon the previous one. It demonstrates my proficiency in HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript, React, Next.js, form validation, and MongoDB integration.

Thank you
