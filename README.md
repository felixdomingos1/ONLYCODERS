# Fullstack Developer Coding Test

This repository contains my solutions for the JavaScript Developer Coding Test. The test is designed to assess my skills and expertise in JavaScript programming, front-end development, and back-end development. The test consists of three levels:

## Level 1: Front-end Development

### Project Overview

For Level 1, I have created a sample web page that showcases my expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6). The web page is designed to mimic the attached sample, paying attention to detail, mobile-friendliness, and animations. I have also incorporated Bootstrap for responsiveness and ReactJS to demonstrate my proficiency in modern JavaScript frameworks.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- ReactJS

### Project Structure

The project structure for Level 1 consists of the following key components:

- `src/`: Contains React components and JavaScript files for the front-end.
- `public/`: The public directory for static assets.

### Acknowledgment

I acknowledge that my expertise primarily lies in backend development, and the front-end development in this project may not be up to the mark. I have invested more time and effort in the backend aspects to showcase my strengths.

### Running the Project

To view the web page, you can set up a development server for React by navigating to the `src/` directory and running the development server command.

## Level 2: Front-end and Back-end Integration

### Project Overview

For Level 2, I have created a simple form that collects user information and sends it to the backend for validation. The front-end form includes fields for email, password, and confirm password. I've implemented form validation and made API calls to the backend to validate user input.

### Technologies Used

- Front-end: Next.js
- Form Validation: Front-end validation

### Project Structure

The project structure for Level 2 includes the following components:

- `app/`: App contains the app layout pages.
- `components/`: Components contains the components used in frontend.

### Running the Project

To run the project:

1. Navigate to the `Task2/` directory and run `npm run dev`.

## Level 3: MongoDB Integration 

### Project Overview

For Level 3, I have integrated MongoDB to store user data provided from the form. The email and password information is stored in a MongoDB database.

### Technologies Used

- Back-end: Node.js (Express.js)
- Database: MongoDB

### Project Structure

The project structure for Level 3 includes the following components:

- `controllers/`: Contains controllers for handling requests.
- `models/`: Includes data models for MongoDB.
- `routes/`: Defines API routes and endpoints.

## Conclusion

This coding test showcases my skills in JavaScript, front-end development, and back-end development. The project is divided into levels, with each level building upon the previous one. It demonstrates my proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Next.js, form validation, and MongoDB integration.

For a detailed overview of each level and how to run the project, please refer to the respective level's section in this README.

Thank you for reviewing my work.
